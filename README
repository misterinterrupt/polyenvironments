Grain
- builds a signal path, plays a sound for a time period
  and then disconnects the nodes in the signal path

  - master context, cloud gain node passed in
  - grain buffer source node created from buffer
  - envelope node created (gain node)
  - panner node created
  - source node connect to panner node
  - panner node connect to envelope gain node
  - envelope gain node connect to cloud gain node

Cloud
- periodically creates a grain of a certain length & other params
  - sound resource passed in
  - set of grains
  - grain parameters
    - density -> rate of new grain creation
    - position -> relative waveform position
    - jitter -> random waveform position offset
    - spread -> random pan amount (default center)
    - length -> length of grain (including attack & release)
    - attack -> initial volume ramp
    - release -> final volume ramp
    - trans -> grain pitch


TODO:

    Control Signals
      % of the screen is an x/y touch pad
      alpha, beta, gamma of accelerometer to grain length, pan, grain density
      gps long/lat changes file position


    Area object
      Boolean: playing
      Boolean: occupied - user gps is within area bounds
      Object: latLongBounds - boundary of area with 4 lat/long props
      Object: config for how clouds start and stop grains

    Audio
      define various cloud configs
